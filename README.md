# Oscitune
I made Oscitune by following a guided project called Oscillart for the Athena Awards.
This was my first time combining art, music, and code, and I thought it was so cool how JavaScript could be used to create both sound and visuals. 
The Oscillart tutorial showed me how to use tools like the Web Audio API to play notes in the browser and HTML canvas to draw animated waveforms that move with the sound.
I spent a total of 8 hours building and customizing this project.

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:
- How to draw and animate waves using the canvas element.
- How to customize a project with my own features and style.
- How fun and creative coding can be, even with just basic JavaScript.
- That small changes like colors or sliders can make a big difference.

After finishing the tutorial, I added my own features like wave thickness control and colorful background.
