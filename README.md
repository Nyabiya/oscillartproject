# oscillartproject
# Oscitune I made Oscitune by following a guided project called Oscillart for the Athena Awards. This was my first time combining art, music, and code, and I thought it was so cool how JavaScript could be used to create both sound and visuals.  The Oscillart tutorial showed me how to use tools like the Web Audio API  and HTML.
